# Liquigen
>
Liquibase Changeset Generation for IntelliJ IDEA
>
## How to Use
This plugin acts as a front-end for several Liquibase command-line actions.

Currently the following actions are supported:
- Generate a Liquibase XML changelog to recreate a selected Data Source from scratch
- Generate a Liquibase XML changelog to create selected database objects for a single Data Source
- Compare two Data Sources - a reference and a target - and generate a Liquibase XML changelog
to transform the target Data Source to the reference

### Generate XML from Data Source
Select a Data Source, then select <kbd>Liquibase</kbd> > <kbd>Generate Changeset</kbd>

### Generate XML from Database Objects
Select a single or several Database Objects, then select <kbd>Liquibase</kbd> > <kbd>Generate Changeset</kbd>

If Liquibase does not support generating XML changeset for selected objects, the resulting XML will be empty.

### Compare two Data Sources
- Select a Data Source, then select <kbd>Liquibase</kbd> > <kbd>Generate Diff</kbd>
- Select a reference Data Source in the pop-up

or

- Select two Data Sources, then select <kbd>Liquibase</kbd> > <kbd>Generate Diff</kbd> on any of them

Generated diff will be based upon which transformations are needed to transform target Data Source to a reference Data Source.

This operation is not symmetric.
